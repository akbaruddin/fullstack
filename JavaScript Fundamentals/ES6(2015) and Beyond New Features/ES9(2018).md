- Rest/Spread Properties
- Asynchronous iteration
- Promise.prototype.finally()
- Regular Expression improvements

### Rest/Spread Properties

```javascript
const { first, second, ...others } = { first: 1, second: 2, third: 3, fourth: 4, fifth: 5 }

first // 1
second // 2
others // { third: 3, fourth: 4, fifth: 5 }
```

### Asynchronous iteration
The new construct for-await-of allows you to use an async iterable object as the loop iteration

```javascript
for await (const line of readLines(filePath)) {
  console.log(line)
}
```

### Promise.prototype.finally()
When a promise is fulfilled, successfully it calls the `then()` methods, one after another.
If something fails during this, the `then()` methods are jumped and the `catch()` method is executed.
`finally()` allow you to run some code regardless of the successful or not successful execution of the promise

```javascript
fetch('file.json')
  .then(data => data.json())
  .catch(error => console.error(error))
  .finally(() => console.log('finished'))
```
